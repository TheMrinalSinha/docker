the purpose of this tiny little application is to make a dock or container
that contains a web application, the app indicates the number of times at
this point that someone essentially has visited this server.

to build this we need two seperate components
NODE_APP & REDIS (visits=10)

one way is to create our node application and put REDIS
inside the same container.

In nodeapp section we'll write all the section required to implement this node application.
