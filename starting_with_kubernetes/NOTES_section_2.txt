Introduction to kubernetes
==========================

(COE's) Containers Orchestration Engine
----------------------------------------
Important Questions:
Google runs average of 2 Billion Containers every week
-> How are these containers created and managed at such large scale
-> How do all these containers connect and communicate
-> How do you scale these containers as per the traffic demands

Concepts:
Objective:
    1. When COE is not always required ?
        > not required for small companies
    2. But, when that will be a problem ?
    3. What is Container Orchestration Engine ?
    4. COE features

What is Container Orchestration Engine ?
-> Container Orchestration Engine automates deploying,
   scaling, & managing containerized applications on a
   group of servers.
   eg: tools availabe are: Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos

Features:
-> clustering
-> scheduling
-> scalability
-> Load balancing
-> Fault Tolerance
-> Deployment (different methods of deployment)


TOP 3 Container Orchestration Engines
--------------------------------------
Most people are familiar with Kubernetes as one of the best
container Orchestration engine (COEs)

Objective:
-> Top 3 COE's
-> Marathon by Apache Mesos
-> Docker Swarm
-> Kubernetes
-> Cloud specific COE's
-> choosing COE's

Marathon (Apacha Mesos)
-----------------------
-> Apacha Mesos is an open-source cluster manager
-> Marathon framework for containers Orchestration
-> has more than 20 framework
-> More complex architecture than swarm
Typical users
    -> Large enterprises
    -> Which requires lot of compute such as big data
    -> driven by developers
    -> need an ops team to manage

Docker Swarm
-------------
-> written in golang
-> easy to understand and get started
-> simple architecture than kubernetes and Mesos
Typical Users:
    -> smaller teams (startups and medium-size companies)
    -> typically greenfield projects
    -> developer-driven temas who need to deploy product

Kubernetes
-----------
-> Strongest community that anyone other COE's
-> straight out of google inc.
-> managed by cncf


Cloud specific container services
----------------------------------
AWS, Azure, GCM (cloud providers)
-> Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
-> EC2 Container Servies
-> Azure Container Services
