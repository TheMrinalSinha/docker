=====================

Objectives:
    Part 1:
        -> What is Kubernetes ?
        -> History @ Google Inc.
        -> Current Status (Goals and who is managing it)
    Part 2:
        -> Why Kubernetes is best COEs?
           (largest deploment so far, various status why it is the best)

PART: 1

-> "BORG" is propritary container manager of google
-> Kubernetes is a slimed down verison of "BORG"
-> released Kubernetes v1 around mid 2015
Goals and consideration:
    1. Empower application developers
    2. Provide standard deployment interface
    3. Build on modular API code

Also, called as K8s - Kubernetes

PART: 2
========
Why Kubernetes ?
----------------
-> By Google Inc.
-> Denoted to CNCF and Open-source
