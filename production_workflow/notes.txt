=== Creating a production grade workflow ===

flow that we are going to see:
[Deployment -> Testing -> Development]
will see what are tech needed to setup this development workflow

-> Our development workflow is going to revolve around creating a github repository
this repository is going to kind of serve as a central point of coordination for all
code that we'll write.

-> our github repository is going to have two different branch one is going to be
feature branch which is essentially the development branch. The other one will be
master branch, it represents our very clean working copy of our codebase.

-> Any flow that we make to this branch right here are going to be eventually
automatically deploy to on hosting provider. Wer are never going to push our code
directly to the master branch we'll push all our changes to the feature branch (all push and pull)
Once you push your changes to the feature branch you are going to create a pull request to merge
changes to the master branch.
